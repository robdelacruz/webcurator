# Web Curator

Website and Blog generator

## Goals

Edit your website or blog using text files with annotations. And run webc.pl to generate the html.

Sample input file:

<BOF>
WEBC 1.0
Title: The title of the web page
Date: 2016-04-06
Author: rob

The text of the web page.

This will likely use markdown format in the future. Currently not yet implemented.
