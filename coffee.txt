###Coffee Varieties

There are two main types of coffee: _Arabica_ and _Robusta_. Arabica is considered to be of higher quality, yet more expensive. Often, a coffee blend is created by mixing several types of coffee bean varieties together.

A third type of coffee - _Liberica_, also known as **Barako** coffee, is available from the Philippines and is said to be of high quality similar to Arabica.

There are different ways of preparing coffee: through filter via a manual drip or drip machine, through french press, through a perculator, or through a high pressure espresso extractor. A new device, called the [aeropress](http://www.aerobie.com/product/aeropress/) is said to be a good way to extract coffee of quality similar to an espresso machine.
